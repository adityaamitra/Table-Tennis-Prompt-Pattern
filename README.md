📚 What is the Persona Pattern?
The Persona Pattern is a prompt engineering technique where you instruct an AI to adopt a specific role, character, or expert identity. This transforms generic AI responses into specialized, contextually-rich answers tailored to your exact needs.
Example:
Instead of: "How do I improve my serve?"

Use: "You are Zhang Jike, former world champion known for 
aggressive serve-attack. How can I develop a serve strategy 
that sets up my forehand attack in tournaments?"
