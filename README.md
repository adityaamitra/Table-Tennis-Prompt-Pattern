> An interactive educational website exploring the Persona Pattern in prompt engineering through the engaging lens of table tennis coaching.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive educational website that teaches the **Persona Pattern**—a powerful prompt engineering technique for getting expert-level responses from AI systems. By using table tennis as a relatable application domain, the site makes advanced AI concepts accessible and practical.

**Live Demo:** [View Website](https://adityaamitra.github.io/Table-Tennis-Prompt-Pattern/)

## 📚 What is the Persona Pattern?

The Persona Pattern is a prompt engineering technique where you instruct an AI to adopt a specific role, character, or expert identity. This transforms generic AI responses into specialized, contextually-rich answers tailored to your exact needs.

**Example:**
```
Instead of: "How do I improve my serve?"

Use: "You are Zhang Jike, former world champion known for 
aggressive serve-attack. How can I develop a serve strategy 
that sets up my forehand attack in tournaments?"
```
